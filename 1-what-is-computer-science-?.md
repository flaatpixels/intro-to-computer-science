## What is Computer Science ?
Contrary to popular belief, Computer Science is not simply the study of computers. Computers play an important role in this discipline. But they are just a tool.

Computer science is more likely the art of studying problems, and developing computable solutions to those problems. This is what we call in other words: ***Problem Solving***.

### An example case
Consider the case that we need to calculate the square of a number (The number 10 for example). To bring a solution to that problem, we'll need:
1. The number to be squared. In our case *10*. This represents the data that we have to deal with. In computer science jargon, we call this an ***Input***.
2. The formula, or the steps to find the *square of 10*. This can be a list of instructions to follow, probably in a specific order, in order to find the desired result. In computer science jargon, we call this an ***Algorithm***.

An algorithm generally produces a result. In Computer Science Jargon, The result that produces an Algorithm is called ***Output***. In our case here, If our algorithm is correct, it has to produce *100* as output (Because *100* is the square of *10*). If it produces another output, that means there is something wrong in our Algorithm. We might not use the right  formula to calculate the square of 10.

## In a nutshell
- Computer is more likely the art of *Solving Problems*
- As computer scientists, you'll always have to deal with:
1. Inputs
2. Process that inputs through Algorithms
3. These algorithms will produce outputs, based on the inputs
